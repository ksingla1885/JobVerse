# JobVerse by Ketan

## Project Overview

JobVerse is a modern, full-stack job portal designed to connect job seekers with employers. It features a clean, intuitive user interface and a robust backend to manage users, job postings, and applications.

## Code Optimization & Normalization

This project has been optimized by applying principles analogous to database normalization to the frontend codebase. This approach enhances maintainability, reduces redundancy, and improves the overall code structure.

### 1. First Normal Form (1NF): Atomic Components

- **Principle**: Just as 1NF eliminates repeating groups in a database, we break down large, monolithic components into smaller, single-purpose, "atomic" components.
- **Benefit**: This improves reusability and makes components easier to understand, test, and maintain.

### 2. Second Normal Form (2NF): Separation of Concerns

- **Principle**: 2NF requires that all non-key attributes be fully dependent on the primary key. In our frontend, this translates to separating business logic and data fetching from UI components.
- **Implementation**: We extract data-fetching logic, API calls, and complex state management into custom hooks.
- **Benefit**: UI components become purely presentational, while the logic becomes reusable and easier to test independently.

### 3. Third Normal Form (3NF): Centralized State Management

- **Principle**: 3NF removes transitive dependencies. In our application, this means avoiding prop drilling and ensuring that state is managed in a single, centralized location when it's shared across multiple components.
- **Implementation**: We use Redux for global state management, ensuring that components have direct access to the state they need without unnecessary data passing through intermediate components.
- **Benefit**: This simplifies data flow, makes state changes more predictable, and improves application performance.
